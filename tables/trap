Name:
  trigg(optional): trigger2
  deliv(optional): delivery
  avoid(optional): avoidance
  loc(optional): location1
  descript(optional): descrip
  payload: payload
 
Hmm. Do I write out every configuration in the yaml file, or do I have a flag or something?

Too complicated --- use the DM's BRAIN --- he is good at figuring out the trigger and location!

actual yaml file should look like:

Name:
  weight: 1 (optional, defaults to 1)
  payload: (mandatory)
